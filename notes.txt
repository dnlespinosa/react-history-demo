History of React 
    The ACTUAL history of it, like The Rommell book you have in your room. History 

Early 
    React.createClass in 2013
        const Message = React.createClass({
            render() {
                return <h1>Hello World!</h1>
            }
        })
    
ES2015
    React envolved to class based components 
        class Message extends React.component {
            render () {
                return <h1>Hello World</h1>
            }
        }

    Every component extends React.component
    Class components must have a render method describing what the component should render

What ABout State
    With class components, we dont use hooks, instead state is intiialized in the constructor
    State is changed with the instance method setState

Instance Method and This
    Instead of writing out event handlers as inline arrow functions, we can also write them as instance methods
